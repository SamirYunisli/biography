It is first week day 2 homework about HTML and CSS lessons.
The homework is almost complited. 2 problems occur here:
*I haven't used 'header' tag, that is why I couldn't set the background of the header as it's needed.
*There is a requirement as 'making the container have a width of 1024px'. I couldn't be able to figure out where I should use container and header as well.
